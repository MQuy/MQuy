### Partition Cache

Browsers used to use shared cache, it means

- if you visit `example1.test` which uses `htpps://cdn.test/react.js`, a browser downloads and puts into a cache.
- later you visit `example2.test` which also uses `https://cdn.test/react.js`, a browser then gets `react.js` from a cache instead.

Due to securiy issues (like tracking abuse), browers move away from that approach and use [partition cache](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#network-partition-keys).

### Prefetch

With `prefetch`, we can hint browsers to load resources when it is available, then later when you want to get that resource, browers get it from a cache. For example, in both `example1.test` (C1) and `example2.test` (C2) contains the element:

```html
<link rel="prefetch" href="example1.test/next" />
```

Browers request and store that url and its content into a cache:

```md
| Resource                         | Content |
| -------------------------------- | :-----: |
| example1.test:example1.test/next |  chunk  |
| example2.test:example1.test/next |  chunk  |
```

The problem arises in C2 (`example2.test` contains prefetch `example1.test/next`), should we use the key `example1.test:example1.test/next` or `example2.test/example1.test/next` (each browser has its [own behaviour](https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/6723)). Depend on where that prefetch link element belongs to:

- In iframe, `example2.test:example1.test/next`.
- In top-level, `example1.test:example1.test/next`.

With [prefetch spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/resource-hints/#prefetch), we cannot specify which case it is. Since for case, browers might send a request with different configuration which leads to different responses. For example:

```
// Top-level
Sec-Fetch-Dest: document

// Iframe
Sec-Fetch-Dest: iframe
```
