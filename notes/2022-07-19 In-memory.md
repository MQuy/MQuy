### Memcached

Memcached organizes memory into `page`, `slab` and `chunk`. `Page` is primary storage which is assigned to `slab class`, then cut into `chunks` of a specific size for that `slab class`. Items (key + misc data + value) are stored into the slab class of nearest fit.

Memcached periodically scans the cache and frees expired objects (prior 1.5 it doesn't). Items are evicted if they have not expired, the slab class is completely out of free chunks and there are no free pages to assign a slab class. Since memcahed uses LRU cache, it looks at the end of LRU for items to reclaim.

```
$ memcached -vv
slab class   1: chunk size        96 perslab   10922a (chunks/items)
slab class   2: chunk size       120 perslab    8738
slab class   3: chunk size       152 perslab    6898
slab class   4: chunk size       192 perslab    5461
slab class   5: chunk size       240 perslab    4369
slab class   6: chunk size       304 perslab    3449
slab class   7: chunk size       384 perslab    2730
slab class   8: chunk size       480 perslab    2184
slab class   9: chunk size       600 perslab    1747
slab class  10: chunk size       752 perslab    1394
...
```

**An example**:

- add 96 bytes item A to freshly started memcached. Memcahed picks a first free page (page 1), assigns slab class 1, and append A into page 1.
- add 20 bytes item B (overhead loss of 76 bytes). Memcached uses page 1, since it has slab class 1, and append B into page 1.
- add 400 bytes item C. Memcache picks a second free page (page 2), assigns slab class 8, and appendC into page 2.

### Redis

Redis organizes items via allocating ([jemalloc](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/deps/README.md)) one after one.

```
$ redis-cli info memory
# Memory
used_memory:1909040
used_memory_human:1.82M
...
mem_fragmentation_ratio:1.87      # ration > 1 indicates fragmentation is occuring
mem_fragmentation_bytes:1631872
...
```

**An example**:

- add 50 bytes item A.
- add 600 bytes item B, B is located right after A -> A | B.
- add 10 bytes item C, C is located right after C -> A | B | C.
- later, item B is expired, there will be a hole in memory -> A | x | C.
